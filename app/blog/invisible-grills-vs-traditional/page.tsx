          <h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-6">Invisible Grills vs Traditional Iron Grills — Which Is Better for Bangalore Homes?</h1>
          <div className="prose prose-gray prose-headings:font-bold max-w-none">
            <p>If you are considering grill options for your Bangalore apartment's windows and balconies, you are likely deciding between invisible grills (stainless steel cable grills) and traditional iron or aluminium grills. Both have their place — but in 2024, invisible grills are rapidly winning over Bangalore homeowners. Here is an honest comparison.</p>
            <h2>What Are Invisible Grills?</h2>
            <p>Invisible grills use high-tensile SS316 stainless steel cables (typically 2–3mm diameter) tensioned vertically between aluminium alloy channels on the top and bottom of a window or balcony opening. They are called "invisible" because the thin cables are nearly imperceptible from a distance, preserving your view completely.</p>
            <h2>What Are Traditional Iron Grills?</h2>
            <p>Traditional iron or mild steel grills are welded bar grills fixed into the window or balcony frame. They are typically painted or powder-coated to resist rust. Stainless steel variants use SS304 or SS202 grade steel.</p>
            <h2>Head-to-Head Comparison</h2>
            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p><strong>Invisible grills:</strong> Each cable holds 300+ kg. Cable spacing of 5–8 cm prevents children and pets from passing through. Certified child-safe. In an emergency, cables can be cut for escape (unlike solid bars).</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional grills:</strong> Strong but can be a fire escape hazard. Fixed bars make emergency exit difficult.</p>
            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p><strong>Invisible grills:</strong> Nearly invisible — your view remains 100% unobstructed. Modern, clean look that matches premium apartment interiors.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional grills:</strong> Significantly block the view. Can look institutional and dated in modern apartments.</p>
            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p><strong>Invisible grills:</strong> SS316 requires zero maintenance — it does not rust, corrode, or need repainting. Wipe clean with a damp cloth.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional grills:</strong> Iron grills rust and require annual repainting in Bangalore's humid climate. Even SS grills develop discolouration over time.</p>
            <h3>Price</h3>
            <p><strong>Invisible grills:</strong> ₹150–₹250/sq ft — higher upfront cost but zero maintenance cost over 20+ years.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional grills:</strong> ₹80–₹150/sq ft — lower upfront, but add repainting costs (₹30–₹60/sq ft every 2–3 years) and eventual replacement cost.</p>
            <h3>Lifespan</h3>
            <p><strong>Invisible grills:</strong> 20+ years with SS316. No degradation in Bangalore's monsoon climate.</p>
            <p><strong>Traditional grills:</strong> Iron grills last 5–10 years before significant rust. SS grills last longer but still discolour.</p>
            <h2>The Verdict</h2>
            <p>For most Bangalore apartment owners, invisible grills are the better long-term choice — especially for living rooms, bedrooms, and anywhere with a view. They are safer (especially for children), look dramatically better, and require zero maintenance. The higher upfront cost is offset by the savings on maintenance and longevity.</p>
            <p>Traditional iron grills still make sense for utility areas, older buildings where the aesthetic difference is less important, or where budget is the primary consideration.</p>
