          <div className="prose prose-gray prose-headings:font-bold max-w-none">
            <p>Bird nets are one of the most effective ways to permanently solve bird problems on Bangalore apartment balconies and terraces. This guide covers everything from choosing the right type to understanding the installation process and costs.</p>
            <h2>When Do You Need a Bird Net?</h2>
            <p>You need a bird net if you experience: pigeons nesting on your balcony or AC unit, bird droppings on your balcony furniture or flooring, bird noise disrupting your mornings, feathers blocking drains, or birds entering your home through open balcony doors.</p>
            <h2>Types of Bird Nets for Bangalore Apartments</h2>
            <h3>HDPE Knotted Bird Net</h3>
            <p>The most common type. Made from high-density polyethylene twine, knotted at each mesh intersection. UV-stabilised for outdoor use. Available in 15–50mm mesh sizes. Durable and cost-effective. Best for most Bangalore apartment balconies.</p>
            <h3>Nylon Bird Net</h3>
            <p>Lighter than HDPE. Finer mesh available (down to 15mm). Better transparency — less visible than HDPE. Slightly higher cost. Best for situations where aesthetics matter or very small birds need to be excluded.</p>
            <h3>SS Wire Bird Net</h3>
            <p>Stainless steel wire mesh. Most durable option — 15+ years. Heavier and more expensive. Best for large open areas or very persistent bird problems where HDPE nets are being pecked through.</p>
            <h2>Choosing the Right Mesh Size</h2>
            <p>Match the mesh size to the bird type: 15–20mm for small birds (sparrows, mynas), 25–50mm for pigeons and crows, 50–75mm for open terrace areas where small birds are not a concern.</p>
            <h2>Bird Net Installation Process</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Site assessment:</strong> Our technician measures the balcony, identifies entry points, and selects the right net type.</li>
              <li><strong>Hook installation:</strong> SS304 cup hooks are drilled into the top, sides, and bottom of the balcony at 12–18 inch intervals.</li>
              <li><strong>Net cutting:</strong> The net is cut to precise dimensions for clean, taut coverage with no gaps.</li>
              <li><strong>Net installation:</strong> The net is threaded through the hooks and tensioned uniformly.</li>
              <li><strong>Quality check:</strong> Every seam and corner is checked to ensure there are no gaps that birds can enter through.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Bird Net Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Bird nets require minimal maintenance: clean every 3–6 months with a garden hose or broom, check tension annually and retighten if needed, repair small tears immediately with cable ties or patch material, replace nets every 5–8 years (or as needed).</p>
            <h2>Bird Net Price in Bangalore</h2>
            <p>HDPE bird nets: ₹8–₹15/sq ft. Nylon bird nets: ₹12–₹18/sq ft. All prices include materials and installation. Free site inspection. Call Nagamani Safety Nets on {BUSINESS.phoneDisplay}.</p>
