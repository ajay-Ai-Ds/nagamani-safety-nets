  { question: "What is a duct area net?", answer: "Duct area nets are safety nets installed across the open top or sides of apartment building duct spaces — the narrow shafts between buildings used for ventilation, plumbing, and electrical runs. They prevent birds, debris, and accidental falls into the duct." },
  { question: "Why are duct area nets important?", answer: "Without nets, duct areas accumulate bird droppings, nesting material, and debris that creates odours and drain blockages. There is also a risk of children accidentally falling into open duct spaces." },
  { question: "What is the price of duct area safety nets?", answer: "Duct area net prices range from ₹10–₹20 per sq ft depending on access difficulty and duct dimensions. Call us on +91 7780613454 for a free site inspection." },
  { question: "How long does duct net installation take?", answer: "Standard duct net installation takes 2–4 hours. Some high-rise or difficult-access ducts may require half a day." },

            <h2>Duct Area Safety Nets in Bangalore</h2>
            <p>Most apartment buildings in Bangalore have one or more duct areas — narrow vertical shafts between buildings or within a building that house utility lines, ventilation pipes, and plumbing. These ducts are often open at the top, creating entry points for birds and accumulation of debris.</p>
            <p>Nagamani Safety Nets installs purpose-built duct area nets that cover these open spaces, preventing bird intrusion, debris accumulation, and accidental falls.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Problems Caused by Unprotected Duct Areas</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Pigeons and other birds nesting inside the duct</li>
              <li>Bird droppings causing odour and drain blockages</li>
              <li>Dead birds creating hygiene issues</li>
              <li>Leaves and rubbish accumulating in the duct</li>
              <li>Risk of children and pets falling into the duct</li>
            </ul>

          <div>
            <h2>Our Duct Net Installation Process</h2>
