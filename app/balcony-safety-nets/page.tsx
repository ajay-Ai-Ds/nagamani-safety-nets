  { question: "What are balcony safety nets and how do they work?", answer: "Balcony safety nets are high-tensile nylon or HDPE nets fitted across balcony openings and railings. They create a protective barrier that prevents children, pets, and adults from falling through. They are UV-resistant, weatherproof, and designed to withstand significant impact force." },
  { question: "What is the price of balcony safety nets in Bangalore?", answer: "Balcony safety net prices in Bangalore range from ₹12 to ₹18 per square foot for standard nylon nets. The exact price depends on mesh size, net thickness, balcony dimensions, and floor height. Call Nagamani Safety Nets on +91 7780613454 for a free quote after site inspection." },
  { question: "How long do balcony safety nets last?", answer: "Our UV-stabilised balcony safety nets last 5–10 years under normal Bangalore conditions. We provide a 1-year installation warranty. Regular cleaning (once every 3–6 months with water) extends the life further." },
  { question: "Are balcony safety nets visible from outside?", answer: "Quality nylon safety nets are nearly invisible from a distance. From inside your apartment, the view is barely affected. Invisible grills are an alternative if you want a completely clear view." },
  { question: "Can balcony safety nets hold a person's weight?", answer: "Yes. Our balcony safety nets are tested to withstand a force of 200–300+ kg per square metre, well above the weight of a child or adult. They comply with safety standards and include certified load ratings." },

            <h2>Balcony Safety Nets in Bangalore</h2>
            <p>Balcony safety nets are one of the most essential safety products for apartment dwellers in Bangalore. With thousands of high-rise apartments in areas like Whitefield, HSR Layout, and Electronic City, the risk of accidental falls from balconies is real — especially for young children, elderly family members, and pets.</p>
            <p>Nagamani Safety Nets provides premium quality balcony safety nets across all areas of Bangalore. Our nets are made from UV-stabilised HDPE and nylon — materials that resist Bangalore's monsoon rains, summer heat, and strong winds without degrading for 5–10 years.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>Why Balcony Safety Nets Are Essential</h2>
            <p>Every year, dozens of tragic accidents involving children falling from balconies are reported in Bangalore. Many of these are preventable with a proper safety net. Here is why balcony safety nets are a must for every Bangalore apartment:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Child protection:</strong> Children aged 1–6 are the most vulnerable. A properly installed net prevents them from climbing through or over balcony railings.</li>
              <li><strong>Pet safety:</strong> Cats and small dogs can fall from upper floor balconies while chasing birds or insects. Safety nets prevent these accidents.</li>
              <li><strong>Elderly protection:</strong> Senior family members with balance issues can lean against a net without fear.</li>
              <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Many parents report sleeping better after installing balcony safety nets.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>Our Balcony Safety Net Materials</h2>
            <p>We use two primary materials for balcony safety nets:</p>
            <h3>1. Nylon Safety Nets</h3>
            <p>High-tensile nylon with 25mm–50mm mesh size. Best for children and pet protection. Load capacity: 150–200 kg/m². UV-stabilised for long life. Available in green, white, and transparent variants.</p>
            <h3>2. HDPE Safety Nets</h3>
            <p>High-density polyethylene nets are stronger and more durable than nylon. They are knotted or knotless and ideal for larger balconies and terraces. Load capacity: 200–300 kg/m².</p>
