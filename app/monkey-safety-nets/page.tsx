  { question: "Are monkey nets really effective?", answer: "Yes. Heavy-gauge HDPE monkey nets with 50–75mm mesh create a physical barrier that monkeys cannot break through or climb over when properly installed. They are the most effective long-term solution for monkey intrusion in Bangalore homes." },
  { question: "What strength of net is needed for monkeys?", answer: "Monkeys are strong and can weigh 5–15 kg. We use heavy-gauge knotted HDPE nets with a breaking strength of 500+ kg per linear metre. Regular bird nets are not strong enough for monkeys." },
  { question: "Do monkey nets harm monkeys?", answer: "No. Our nets are humane deterrents — monkeys cannot enter but are not harmed. They simply move away from the netted area." },
  { question: "Where are monkey nets installed?", answer: "Monkey nets are installed on balconies, terraces, windows, skylights, and around entire building perimeters. In areas like Bannerghatta Road and Yelahanka where monkeys are common, terrace nets are very popular." },
  { question: "What is the price of monkey nets in Bangalore?", answer: "Monkey nets cost ₹18–₹30 per sq ft due to the heavy-gauge material required. Contact us on +91 7780613454 for a free site assessment and exact quote." },

            <h2>Monkey Safety Nets in Bangalore</h2>
            <p>Monkeys are a common problem in many parts of Bangalore, particularly in areas close to forests and lakes such as Bannerghatta Road, Yelahanka, Hennur, Tumkur Road, and parts of North Bangalore. Monkeys raid homes for food, damage property, and can be aggressive when cornered.</p>
            <p>Standard bird nets or balcony safety nets are not designed to hold monkeys. Nagamani Safety Nets provides specially designed heavy-gauge monkey nets that create a strong, permanent barrier.</p>
