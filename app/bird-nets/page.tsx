  { question: "What are bird nets and how do they work?", answer: "Bird nets are fine-mesh nets made from UV-stabilised HDPE or nylon, installed over balconies, windows, courtyards, and open areas. They create a physical barrier that prevents birds from entering or roosting in protected spaces." },
  { question: "Are bird nets harmful to birds?", answer: "No. Our bird nets are designed to humanely deter birds — they act purely as a physical barrier. Birds are not trapped or harmed. They simply cannot enter netted areas and move elsewhere." },
  { question: "What is the difference between bird nets and pigeon nets?", answer: "Pigeon nets are a heavier-gauge variant of bird nets with smaller mesh (typically 25–50mm) designed specifically for larger birds like pigeons. Standard bird nets work for sparrows, mynas, and small birds. We recommend pigeon nets for pigeon-specific problems." },
  { question: "How long do bird nets last?", answer: "Our UV-stabilised HDPE bird nets last 5–8 years in Bangalore's climate. They are resistant to rain, UV radiation, and temperature variation. We provide a 1-year installation warranty." },
  { question: "What is the price of bird nets in Bangalore?", answer: "Bird net prices in Bangalore range from ₹8 to ₹15 per square foot depending on mesh size, material grade, and installation area. Call us on +91 7780613454 for a free site inspection and quote." },
