  { question: "What type of net is used for cricket practice?", answer: "We use HDPE knotless netting or nylon twisted nets for cricket practice. HDPE is preferred for outdoor use as it is UV-stabilised and weatherproof. Mesh size is typically 30–40mm and thickness 2–3mm for durability against hard cricket balls." },
  { question: "Can cricket nets be installed on apartment terraces?", answer: "Yes. We regularly install cricket practice nets on apartment terraces and open terraces across Bangalore. We use powder-coated MS or GI pipe frames anchored securely to the terrace floor with proper waterproofing to prevent seepage." },
  { question: "What is the price of cricket nets in Bangalore?", answer: "Cricket net installation in Bangalore costs ₹25–₹60 per sq ft depending on net grade, frame type (pipe or PVC), and area size. A standard 10x10 metre practice net costs approximately ₹12,000–₹25,000 all inclusive. Call +91 7780613454 for a free quote." },
  { question: "How long do cricket nets last?", answer: "High-quality HDPE cricket nets last 5–8 years outdoors with UV protection. Nylon nets last 3–5 years. The pipe frame structure lasts 10+ years with basic maintenance. We provide a 1-year installation warranty on all cricket net setups." },
  { question: "Can you install cricket nets indoors?", answer: "Yes. We install cricket practice nets in indoor spaces like garages, basements, large halls, and indoor sports academies across Bangalore. Indoor nets use lighter nylon mesh as UV protection is not required." },
