  { question: "What are ceiling cloth hangers?", answer: "Ceiling cloth hangers (also called ceiling cloth drying hangers) are systems mounted on the ceiling of a balcony or utility room that allow you to dry clothes vertically. They use a pulley mechanism or fixed rods to hold 3–6 rods of clothes at ceiling level, freeing up floor space." },
  { question: "How much do ceiling cloth hangers cost in Bangalore?", answer: "Ceiling cloth hangers cost ₹800–₹2,500 per hanger unit in Bangalore depending on rod count, material, and system type. Installation takes under 2 hours. Call us on +91 7780613454." },
  { question: "How much weight can cloth hangers hold?", answer: "Our ceiling cloth hangers are rated for 15–25 kg per unit depending on the model. This is sufficient for a full load of wet laundry." },
  { question: "Do you install ceiling cloth hangers in rental apartments?", answer: "Yes. Our installation uses ceiling hooks that require minimal drilling. We fill holes cleanly and our installation does not violate standard rental agreements." },
  { question: "What is the difference between pulley and fixed cloth hangers?", answer: "Pulley systems let you lower the rods to load/unload clothes and pull them up to the ceiling for drying — ideal for high ceilings. Fixed systems have rods at a fixed height — simpler and more affordable." },

            <h2>Ceiling Cloth Hangers in Bangalore</h2>
            <p>Bangalore's apartments are known for their compact balconies and limited utility space. A ceiling cloth hanger is a simple but brilliant solution that uses the otherwise wasted ceiling space to dry your laundry — freeing up the balcony floor for other uses.</p>
            <p>Nagamani Safety Nets installs premium ceiling cloth hangers across Bangalore. Our hangers are strong, rust-proof, and built to last. Installation takes less than 2 hours and leaves your ceiling clean.</p>

            <h2>Types of Ceiling Cloth Hangers</h2>
            <h3>1. Pulley-System Hangers</h3>
            <p>The most popular type. A rope-and-pulley system lets you lower 3–6 rods to hanging height to load clothes, then pull them up near the ceiling. Ideal for high-ceiling balconies and utility rooms. Price: ₹1,500–₹2,500 per unit.</p>
            <h3>2. Fixed-Rod Hangers</h3>
            <p>Simple aluminium or steel rods mounted at a fixed height on ceiling brackets. Easier to install and more affordable. Ideal for standard-height ceilings (8–9 feet). Price: ₹800–₹1,500 per unit.</p>
            <h3>3. Wall-Mounted Folding Hangers</h3>
            <p>Fold flat against the wall when not in use. Ideal for very compact balconies. Price: ₹600–₹1,200 per unit.</p>
