  { question: "What mesh size is safe for children?", answer: "For children under 5 years, we recommend nets with 25–50mm mesh that is too small for a child to get their head or limbs stuck. Our children's nets are specifically designed with child safety standards." },
  { question: "Can children safety nets be installed on staircases?", answer: "Yes. Staircase safety nets are one of our most popular products for homes with young children. We install nets along the open side of staircases, across banisters, and at stair landings to prevent falls." },
  { question: "Are children safety nets strong enough to stop a fall?", answer: "Our children's safety nets are tested to withstand a dynamic load of 150–200 kg per sq metre — far exceeding the force of a child's fall. They are used in apartments, villas, and playgrounds across Bangalore." },
  { question: "What is the price of children safety nets?", answer: "Children's safety nets in Bangalore cost ₹12–₹20 per sq ft depending on net grade and installation area. Contact us for a free quote after site inspection." },
  { question: "Do children safety nets look ugly?", answer: "No. Our nets are available in transparent, white, and green variants that blend with your home's interior. Invisible grills are also an option for a more premium, invisible look." },
